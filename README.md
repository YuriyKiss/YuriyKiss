# Hello there, welcome to my page ðŸ‘‹
I am Yurii Kis, a Unity Engineer who has been mostly working on VR/AR applications lately. Here you can find different projects I was working on in my spare time, at university, and during freelance experience, and in the future you will find commercial projects I am most proud of.

### Projects I've worked on:
