# Hello there, welcome to my page ðŸ‘‹
I am Yurii Kis, Unity Engineer who has lately been mostly working on VR/AR appplications. Here you can find different projects I was working on on my spare time, at university, during freelance experience and in the future you would find commercial projects I am most proud of.

### I am proud of:
* [Anouschka](https://adoato.itch.io/anouschka) a narrative-driven AR game that won [IDFA DocLab award for Digital Storytelling](https://festival.idfa.nl/en/news/idfa-award-for-best-film-naar-1489-en-canutos-transformation/)

### Game Prototypes in stores:
* Hidden Thief [Android / [iOS](https://apps.apple.com/ua/app/hidden-thief/id1591001397)]
* Macrame DIY: (Obi Ropes) [[Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.vasylevych.macrame) / iOS], (Dreamteck Splines) [[YouTube](https://youtube.com/shorts/9g6yPJ8aPjA)]
